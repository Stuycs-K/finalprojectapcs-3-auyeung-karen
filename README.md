# Project Description

This project is a Candy Crush game made in Java. The goal of the game is to match three or more candies of the same type to score points and while meeting a certain goal. The player interacts with the game by swapping adjacent candies, with new candies falling into the board to replace the cleared candies.

The game will feature a 9x9 grid game board where the candies are displayed. Matches made will increase the score. The goal is to get the highest score possible in a limited number of moves.

# Intended usage:

Click on candy squares to select/deselect them. While a candy is selected, click on adjacent candies that will make a match of three or more to crush them. If candies are not adjacent to each other, or do not make a match, the candies will not be swapped.

The score increases every time rows or columns of candies are crushed. A game over screen will appear when the number of moves left reaches zero. Players will be unable to continue the game when it does.

Press 'r' or 'R' to reset the score and number of moves; high score will be kept.

Press '+' to increase the number of moves left.

Press '-' to decrease the number of moves left.
