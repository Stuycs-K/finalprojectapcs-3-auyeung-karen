# IDEAS:

1 Candy Crush

Players have to swap adjacent candies to create rows or columns of three or more of the same type. Matching candies disappear and new ones refill the board. Matching candies score points; players will either have to reach a certain score to win or play indefinitely.

Scope:
  9x9 grid
  Swap mechanic
  Matching mechanic
  Gravity mechanic (so candies fall down + replace board)
  Score counter

2 Bubble Shooter

A bubble popping game where players have to shoot colored bubbles upward. When three or more same-colored bubbles touch, they pop. The goal is to clear the screen before running out of bubbles to shoot.

Scope:
  Limited number of bubbles
  Gravity mechanic
  Bubble collision + sticking logic
  Matching mechanic
  Game over/win mechanic

3 2048

Players have to slide tiles across the screen to add up numbers. The game goes on indefinitely until the screen is full with blocks and there are no more moves to be made. There is a score counter

Scope:
  4x4 (or customizable?) grid
  Arrow keys or WASD inputs for control
  Merge logic
  New tiles that spawn after each moves
  Game over mechanic
  Score counter
